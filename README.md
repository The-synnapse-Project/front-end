## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ installed
- Package manager: npm, yarn, or bun
- Access to Google OAuth credentials (for full auth functionality)
- Rocket API backend running (locally or remote)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Synnapse.git
   cd Synnapse/front-end
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   bun install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**

   Copy the example environment file and configure your variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Then edit `.env.local` with your specific configuration:

### Environment Variables

```
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000  # Rocket API URL

# Authentication
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-nextauth-secret  # Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000    # Your app's URL

# Optional Configuration
NODE_ENV=development                  # development, production
```

### Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
# or
yarn build
yarn start
# or
bun run build
bun start
```

## üîå API Integration

The frontend connects to a Rocket-based API for all data services. Key integration points:

- **API Client**: Located at `src/lib/api-client.ts`

  - Handles all HTTP requests to the backend
  - Includes authentication headers and error handling

- **Auth Integration**: Located at `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
  - Configures NextAuth.js with dual providers
  - Manages session handling and token refreshing

## üîê Authentication Flow

### Email/Password Authentication

1. User enters credentials on the login page
2. Credentials are sent to the Rocket API for verification
3. Upon successful verification, a JWT token is returned
4. NextAuth creates a session with this token
5. User is redirected to their role-specific dashboard

### Google Authentication

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google"
2. Google OAuth flow is initiated via NextAuth
3. Upon successful Google authentication:
   - If the email matches an existing user, they are logged in
   - If no match is found, a new user account is created
4. A session is created with appropriate role permissions
5. User is redirected to their role-specific dashboard
